python-readline
===============

The standard Python readline extension statically linked against the GNU readline library, providing readline support to Python on platforms without it.

This package is **DEPRECATED** and has been renamed to **gnureadline** to resolve a name clash with the standard library module. The main repository is at [python-gnureadline](https://github.com/ludwigschwardt/python-gnureadline). The old package is still available on PyPI for now.
